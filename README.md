# PI-M4 Biogenesis Analysis with Python
Jul 2024
-We took on the role of a data analyst for Biogenesis, using data on how the COVID-19 pandemic was managed in Latin America. The goal was to help Biogenesis choose the best country for expansion from five options: Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru.
-Technologies used: Python, Power BI.
First, we "cleaned" the data in Python, choosing Python because we initially had 22 million rows, which we filtered down to just over 3,700 for the target countries, making it much more manageable. Then, we analyzed a large amount of data on how the different countries handled the pandemic. We presented our findings in Power BI dashboards to share insights. In the end, we decided that Brazil was the best initial target due to its large population.
